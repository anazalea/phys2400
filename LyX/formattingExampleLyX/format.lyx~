Abstract

\begin_layout Standard
This is where you should write a quick summary of your experiment and most
 interesting results.
 In the real world, the 
\series bold
Abstract
\series default
 (and probably
\series bold
 Conclusions
\series default
 too) will often be the only section people read so it's important to make
 it concise and pack a powerful scientific punch.
 Think of it as a trailer full of spoilers for a movie so incredibly awesome
 that you still want to pay money to see the whole thing.
 If you have numerical results it's a good idea to include them.

The typical spices used in winter include nutmeg, cinnamon, clove and anise.
 These spices contain two groups of chemicals, the allylbenzenes and their
 isomers, the propenylbenzenes.
 It was suggested 40 years ago by Alexander Shulgin that these substances
 act as metabolic precursors of amphetamines.
 The biotransformation of these precursors to nitrogen-containing metabolites
 is reviewed.
 These reactions have not been reported in humans.
 Whether or not the pharmacology and toxicology of spices such as nutmeg
 can be explained on the basis of their allylbenzene or propenylbenzene
 content is speculative.
 Humans may be exposed to amphetamines derived from these precursors in
 forno, the formation during baking and cooking, for example in the preparation
 of Lebkuchen, or Christmas gingerbread.
 It is possible that this may be responsible, in part, for uplifting our
 mood in winter.
 However, the role of these aromatic substances, acting simply as odours,
 evoking old memories of winters past, cannot be ignored.
 Whether spices have a true pharmacological effect or they act as aromatherapy
 remains to be elucidated through clinical and laboratory studies.

One of the most familiar features of a bundle of hair such as a ponytail
 is its `body' or `volume.' Close examination reveals that this property
 arises in a subtle way from the stiffness and shapes of the individual
 fibers, whose meandering paths through the bundle produce many collisions
 with other hairs.
 These meanderings are in part a consequence of the contacts themselves,
 but hairs also have an intrinsic waviness or curliness.
 Such curvatures may be generated during growth, and vary with ethnicity.
 They are clearly also modied by chemical, thermal, and mechanical forces,
 as in the `water wave' treatment, or a `perm'.
 From Leonardo to the Brothers Grimm our fascination with hair has endured
 in art and science.
 Yet, we still do not have an answer to perhaps the simplest question that
 captures the competing eects of lament elasticity, gravity, and mutual
 interactions: 
\shape slanted
What is the shape of a ponytail?
\shape italic
 Note that the average human has 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{5}$
\end_inset

 head hairs, so if even a modest fraction is gathered into a ponytail, the
 number involved is enormous: this is a problem in statistical physics.

At this point, you might want to include equations to clearly explain the
 theory behind your procedure.
 Later in their paper,

 of the ponytail using their proposed definition of the energy of an axisymmetri
c bundle of hair fibers:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\varepsilon\left[\rho,{\bf {t}}\right]=d^{3}\mathrm{{\bf {r}}}\rho\left(\frac{1}{2}A\kappa^{2}+\varphi({\bf {r}})+\left\langle u\right\rangle \right),\label{eq:pony}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa=\left|\left({\bf t\cdot{\bf \nabla}}\right){\bf t}\right|$
\end_inset

 is the curvature field.
 The terms in Eqn.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:pony"

\end_inset

 are the elastic energy of mean curvature, the bending modulus 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

, the external ( e.g.
 gravitational) potential 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi$
\end_inset

, and a fiber connement energy per unit length 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle u\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 that aggregates all terms involving disorder, such as contacts and natural
 curvatures.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice that the equation is centered, numbered and because it's part of
 the sentence, includes punctuation where appropriate.
 Most word processors are capable of automatically dealing with equation
 formatting.
 If you want to continue in upper year science courses and beyond, you'll
 want to start using LaTeX to format your documents sometime soon.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Apparatus & Procedure
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is where you talk about what physical stuff and/or software you used
 in your experiment and how you used it.
 This section should 
\series bold
not
\series default
 include your results.
 Your goal here is to explain everything thoroughly enough for a reader
 to know how to precisely reproduce your procedure.
 To accomplish this, you'll want to include every tiny detail that might
 be relevant while taking care to state things plainly and be as concise
 as possible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Feel free to add figures or tables that enhance and clarify the explanations
 you provide in writing.
 Note that all figures and tables require a caption.
 These are easy to add in LaTeX and most word processors.
 Make sure that all figures you include get mentioned in the text.

\begin_layout Section
Data & Analysis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now that you've described the finicky details of your procedure, it's time
 to talk about the data it yielded and what you did with them.
 Describe any statistical methods you used to understand your data and state
 all of your numerical results.
 Show off all the plots you made with figures, as described in Section 2.
 You can always refer to things you've labelled in the document, like Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

, Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

The PHYS 2400 lab manual includes specific Analysis Questions throughout.
 They should serve as prompts for things that you'll definitely want to
 touch on as you explain your analysis and results (some of these points
 might belong in the Results and Discussion section, you can go ahead and
 put them there if it feels right.) These points should come up organically
 as you write, but I'm sure Sam will appreciate if you point out places
 where you're answering a question posed in the manual using footnotes

\begin_layout Section
Results & Discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here, you need to summarize the results of your analysis and interpret them.
 Is there anything weird going on? Talk about how accurate your results
 are and what you could do to improve accuracy and minimize uncertainty.
 Discuss the implications of what you've found on the field and what should
 be considered next, science-wise, to advance the state of human knowledge,
 explore the phenomenon more deeply etc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Conclusions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Like I said in the Abstract, there's a good chance that this is one of the
 only things people might read (fortunately for you, we'll pore over every
 word of your lab reports in order to grade you fairly) so you need to make
 it count! Summarize your important results (again), figure out what final
 conclusions you can draw from them and how these conclusions fit into the
 related science that's been done by other people (and maybe you!)
